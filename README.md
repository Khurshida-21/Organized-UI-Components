# Organized-UI-Components

This task focuses on designing and organizing reusable UI components using Figma, following proper structure, naming conventions, and responsive design principles. The objective was to understand how UI components are created, organized, and managed in a clean and professional design system.

 ## Objective

To create common UI components used in a website
To organize them into a structured component library
To ensure reusability, consistency, and responsiveness
To follow a clean and scalable UI workflow

## UI Components Created

The following UI components were designed as part of this task:

- Forms

Table Reservation Form
Includes input fields, labels, and a submit button
Structured for clear user interaction and usability

- Buttons

Primary Button
Secondary Button
Designed with consistent spacing, alignment, and typography to maintain uniformity across the UI.

- Sections

Testimonial Section
Designed to display user feedback
Includes text content, profile image, and navigation indicators

- Icons

Scroll Up Icon
Scroll Down Icon
Used as navigational indicators within the interface.

## Organization of Components

To maintain clarity and scalability, all UI elements were organized into a dedicated UI Component Library page in Figma.

Components were categorized into:
  - Forms
  - Buttons
  - Sections
  - Icons

Each component was placed inside proper frames. Clear and meaningful layer naming conventions were followed (e.g., Button / Primary, Form / Table Reservation)
This structure makes components easy to locate, manage, and reuse across designs

## Component Creation

All UI elements were converted into Figma components, enabling:

Reusability across multiple frames and pages
Consistency throughout the design
Efficient updates using a single source of truth
